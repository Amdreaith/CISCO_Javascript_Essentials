Conditional execution, also known as control flow, is fundamental to programming. It enables code to react to different situations and alter its behavior. 



## üö¶ The `if` Statement

It checks a condition and executes a block of code only if the condition evaluates to `true`.

**Syntax:**



```
if (condition) {
    // block of code to execute if condition is true
}
```

- The `condition` inside the parentheses is evaluated to a Boolean value.
- If `true`, the code within the curly brackets `{}` is executed.
- If `false`, the code block is skipped.

**Example:**



```
let isUserReady = confirm("Are you ready?"); // [Image of a browser confirm dialog box]
if (isUserReady) {
    alert("User ready!"); // [Image of a browser alert dialog box]
}
```

- **Best Practice:** Always use curly brackets `{}` for code blocks, even if it's a single line. This improves readability and prevents common errors when adding more instructions later.

**Scope of Variables in `if` Blocks:**

Variables declared with `let` and `const` inside an `if` block are **local** to that block. They are not accessible outside of it.

JavaScript

```
let unitPrice = 10;
let pieces = prompt("How many pieces do you order?", 0);
if (pieces > 0) {
    let total = unitPrice * pieces; // 'total' is local to this block
    console.log(total);
}
console.log(total); // -> Uncaught ReferenceError: total is not defined
```

**Complex Conditions with Logical Operators:**

You can combine multiple conditions using **logical operators** (`&&` for AND, `||` for OR, `!` for NOT) and **comparison operators** (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `===`, `!==`). Parentheses can be used to control the order of evaluation.

JavaScript

```
let userAge = 23;
let cartValue = 299;
let points = 703;
let shippingCost = 9.99;

if (userAge > 21 && (cartValue >= 300 || points >= 500)) {
    shippingCost = 0;
}
console.log(shippingCost); // Output: 0
```

This condition evaluates to `true` if `userAge` is greater than 21 AND (`cartValue` is greater than or equal to 300 OR `points` is greater than or equal to 500).

### ‚öñÔ∏è The `if ... else` Statement

The `if ... else` statement allows you to execute one block of code if the condition is `true` and a different block1 if the condition is `false`.2

**Syntax:**



```
if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if condition is false
}
```

**Example:**



```
let isUserReady = confirm("Are you ready?");
if (isUserReady) {
    console.log("User ready!");
} else {
    console.log("User not ready!");
}
```

- This structure ensures that one of the two code blocks will always be executed, based on the single condition.

---

### ü™ú The `if ... else if ... else` Statement

For scenarios with more than two possible branches, you can use `if ... else if ... else`. This allows for multiple conditions to be checked sequentially.

**Syntax:**



```
if (condition_1) {
    // code if condition_1 is true
} else if (condition_2) {
    // code if condition_2 is true
} else if (condition_3) {
    // code if condition_3 is true
} else {
    // code if none of the above conditions are true
}
```

**Example:**


```
let number = prompt("Enter a number", 0); // [Image of a browser prompt dialog box]
if (number < 10) {
    alert("<10");
} else if (number < 30) {
    alert("<30");
} else if (number < 60) {
    alert("<60");
} else {
    alert(">=60");
}
```

- JavaScript will stop checking conditions as soon as the first `true` condition is met and execute its corresponding code block.

### ‚ùì Conditional (Ternary) Operator

The conditional operator is a shorthand for simple `if ... else` statements, particularly useful when assigning one of two values to a variable based on a condition.

**Syntax:**



```
variable = condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;
```

**Example:**
```
let price = 100;
let shippingCost = price > 50 ? 0 : 5;
console.log(`price = ${price}, shipping = ${shippingCost}`); // -> price = 100, shipping = 0
```

- This operator returns either `valueIfTrue` (if the `condition` is `true`) or `valueIfFalse` (if the `condition` is `false`).
- While it can execute simple commands, it's generally **recommended to use `if` statements for more complex operations** to maintain code readability.

### üîÑ The `switch ... case` Statement

The `switch` statement evaluates a single expression and then attempts to match its value against multiple `case` clauses. It's often used as an alternative to a long chain of `if ... else if` statements when you're comparing a single variable against multiple discrete values.

**Syntax:**



```
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // code to execute if expression === value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code to execute if expression === value2
        break;
    default:
        // code to execute if no case matches
}
```

- The `expression` is evaluated once.
- Each `case` clause compares the `expression` using a **strict comparison (`===`)**.
- The `break` keyword is crucial; it exits the `switch` statement once a match is found. Without `break`, the code will "fall through" to subsequent `case` blocks.
- The `default` clause is optional and executes if no `case` matches the `expression`.

**Example:**



```
let gate = prompt("Choose gate: a, b, or c");
let win = false;
switch (gate) {
    case "a":
        alert("Gate A: empty");
        break;
    case "b":
        alert("Gate B: main prize");
        win = true;
        break;
    case "c":
        alert("Gate C: empty");
        break;
    default:
        alert("No gate " + String(gate));
}
if (win) {
    alert("Winner!");
}
```
