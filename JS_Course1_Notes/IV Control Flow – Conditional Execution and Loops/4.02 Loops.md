### I. What are Loops? (Repeating Actions)

Loops are another way your code controls its "flow." Think of them as a way to **repeat a set of instructions** either:

I. A specific number of times (e.g., "do this 10 times").

II. Until a certain condition is met (e.g., "keep doing this until the user says stop").

Loops save you from writing the same code over and over! Imagine showing 100 user names â€“ you don't want 100 `console.log` lines! Loops handle that.

### II. The `while` Loop: "Keep doing this WHILE this is true."

The `while` loop keeps running a block of code **as long as a condition remains true**.

**How it works:**

I. Checks the condition first.

II. If true, runs the code inside {}.

III. Goes back to step I.

IV. If false, the loop stops.

**Simple Rule:**

JavaScript

```
while (condition is true) {
    // do this repeatedly
}
```

Example:

Let's count from 0 to 90 by 10s:

JavaScript

```
let n = 0;
while (n < 91) { // WHILE n is less than 91
    console.log(n); // Show n
    n += 10;        // Add 10 to n (very important! prevents infinite loop)
}
// Output: 0, 10, 20, ..., 90
```

**I. Danger!** If the condition _never_ becomes false, you'll have an **infinite loop** (your program gets stuck!). Always make sure something inside the loop changes the condition so it can eventually become false.

**Another Example (user input):**

JavaScript

```
let counter = 1;
let wantsToContinue = true; // Start by wanting to continue

while (wantsToContinue) {
    // Ask the user if they want to continue, increment counter
    wantsToContinue = confirm(`[${counter++}] Continue?`);
}
console.log("Loop finished.");
```

I. The loop keeps asking "Continue?" until the user clicks "Cancel".

---

### III. `do ... while` Loop: "Do this ONCE, then keep doing WHILE this is true."

This loop is similar to `while`, but with one key difference: The code inside the loop always runs at least once before the condition is checked.

**How it works:**

I. Runs the code inside {}.

II. Checks the condition.

III. If true, goes back to step I.

IV. If false, the loop stops.

**Simple Rule:**

JavaScript

```
do {
    // always do this at least once
} while (condition is true); // then keep doing WHILE this is true
```

**Example:**

JavaScript

```
let guess;
do {
    guess = prompt("Guess the secret number (1-5):");
} while (guess != "3"); // Keep asking until they guess '3'
alert("You got it!");
```

I. The `prompt` will always show up at least once.

---

### IV. `for` Loop: "Do this for a specific number of times."

The `for` loop is usually used when you **know how many times** you want to repeat something. It's very organized!

**It has three parts inside the `()` parentheses, separated by semicolons `;`:**

I. Start (Initialization): What happens before the loop begins (e.g., set up a counter let i = 0;).

II. Condition: What must be true for the loop to keep running (e.g., i < 10;).

III. Step (Increment/Decrement): What happens after each time the code runs (e.g., i++ to add 1 to the counter).

**Simple Rule:**

JavaScript

```
for (start; condition; step) {
    // do this repeatedly
}
```

**Example (counting 0 to 9):**

JavaScript

```
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { // Start i at 0; run while i < 10; add 1 to i each time
    console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, ..., 9
}
```

**I. Great for Arrays:** `for` loops are perfect for going through each item in an array. Use `array.length` to automatically know how many items there are.

[Image of sequence of fruits: an apple, then a banana, then a cherry, each in its own box, with numbers 0, 1, 2 under the boxes](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230424124759/Screenshot-2023-04-24-124751.png)

JavaScript

```
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) { // Loop from first item (0) to last
    console.log(fruits[i]); // Output: apple, banana, cherry
}
```

---

### V. `for ... of` Loop: "For EACH item in a collection."

This is a simpler `for` loop designed for **arrays** (and similar lists). It just gives you each item directly.

**Simple Rule:**

JavaScript

```
for (let item of array) {
    // do something with 'item'
}
```

**Example:**

JavaScript

```
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
for (let color of colors) { // For each 'color' in 'colors' array
    console.log(color); // Output: red, green, blue
}
```

---

### VI. `for ... in` Loop: "For EACH property in an object."

This loop is specifically for **objects**. It gives you the **names (keys)** of each property in an object.

**Simple Rule:**

JavaScript

```
for (let key in object) {
    // 'key' will be the name of each property
}
```

**Example:**

JavaScript

```
let person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    city: "New York"
};
for (let propertyName in person) { // For each 'propertyName' in 'person' object
    console.log(propertyName);       // Output: name, age, city
    console.log(person[propertyName]); // Output: Alice, 30, New York (use [] to get the value!)
}
```

---

### VII. `break` and `continue` Statements: "Changing Loop Behavior"

These keywords let you jump around _inside_ a loop.

I. **`break;`**: **Stops the entire loop immediately.** It's like an emergency exit.

````
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i === 5) {
        break; // Stop the loop when i is 5
    }
    console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}
```
````

II. **`continue;`**: **Skips the rest of the current loop cycle** and moves to the next one. It's like skipping a turn.

````
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i === 2) {
        continue; // Skip the rest of this cycle when i is 2
    }
    console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 3, 4 (2 is skipped!)
}
```
````

**I. Note:** `break` is also used in `switch` statements to prevent "fall-through" (where code keeps running into the next `case` even if it doesn't match). If you forget `break` in a `switch`, multiple `case` blocks might run!
