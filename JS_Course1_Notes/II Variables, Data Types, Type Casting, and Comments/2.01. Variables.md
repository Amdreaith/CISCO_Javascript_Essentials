I. Variable 
> allow us to store such results, to modify then or use it on later operations.Imagine variables as a containers which we can store information  and Each container must have "own name".

NOTE ! interpreter knows the difference of lower-case to upper-case letters, also in variable names such as "test", "Test", or "TEST" will be treated differently.

II. DECLARING VARIABLES

How to declare?

	let height;
	
![[Pasted image 20250522145442.png]]
So the container (VARIABLE) here is the height. Declaration ends with ";" / semi-colon.


 - We use keywords "var" or "let" for variables & "const" for constants. One of the basic differences in the use of _var_ and _let_ is that let prevents us from declaring another variable with the same name.
 - Use "var"  to re-declare a variable , which can potentially lead to errors in program execution.

 - Use "let" to declare variables , if  you don't want to accidentally declare a variable again.

III. Initializing Variables
	 Initialize means assigning a value to a variable (Container).

 > To assign a value , we use " = " or equal operator.

III. Declarations and Strict Mode
	" use strict " is a keyword placed at the beginning of the code. 
	 Why use this? It cause the interpreter to deal with the rest of the code using strict mode and we want to force the interpreter to behave according to modern JavaScript standards.

IV. Changing Variable Values 
		We can change the variable values by re-assigning a new value to the variable (Overwrites).

The variable type determines the belonging of a data to a certain same properties and on which you can perform the same operations.


V. Constants
		"const" keywords is used to declare containers similar to variables and the main purpose of a constant is to eradicate the possibility of accidentally changing a value stored in it. 
		Example's :  
			paths to resources
			tokens
			 other data that never change throughout the lifetime of the script.

				Change in constant is impossible.


VI. Scope
		The scope of variable depends on where it is declared.
		
One of the Basic Elements that influence the scope is :

Program Blocks  
		We create "blocks" by using "{} / curly braces" and inserting a "set of instructions" so it can be treated independently. Blocks  are usually associated with conditional instructions, loops, or functions.
		- It can be nested :
		![[Pasted image 20250522160602.png]]
		**Indentation** is when the block moved inside the code (right).This increases readability of the code but this doesn't matter at all.
		
- If we use "let" or "const" outside of the code block, it can be accessed "GLOBAL" .
- if we use it inside the {} / code ,it is accessed only at the  "LOCAL"

- "var" keywords  help us to access the blocks outside(GLOBAL) or internally(LOCAL).

VII. Functions
	A **function** is a separated piece of code that you name,same way that you name a variable. If you want to use it somewhere, you simply refer to it using that name (we say that we _call_ the function).

VIII. "var" keyword
		If we declare a variable using the keyword var inside a function, its scope will be limited only to the inside of that function (it's a local scope).

IX. Variable Shadowing 
		Variable shadowing occurs when you declare a _new_ variable with the _same name_ in an inner scope, thereby "shadowing" the outer variable. The outer variable still exists but is temporarily inaccessible from within the inner scope.

X. Hoisting

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).

NOTE !  It is a good practice to ALWAYS to declare variables before using them.
