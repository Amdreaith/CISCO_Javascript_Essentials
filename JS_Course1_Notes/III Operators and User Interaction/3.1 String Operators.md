1. String operators

The only operator in this group is the **concatenation** +. This operator will convert everything to a **String** if any of the operands is a String type. Finally, it will create a new character string, attaching the right operand at the end of the left operand.

2.Comparison Operators 

== , this will check the equality and inequality of values.

You can compare strings that aren't numbers by looking at each character in the same position. The comparison is based on their order in the alphabet, where uppercase letters are valued less than lowercase letters, and digits are valued even less.

#### OTHER OPERATORS:
#### 1. `typeof`

- A unary operator that checks the type of a variable or literal.
- Returns a string representing the type (e.g., "boolean", "number").

---

#### 2. `instanceof`

- A binary operator that checks if an object is of a specific type.
- Returns `true` or `false`.
- Commonly used to check if a variable is an array.

---

#### 3. `delete`

- A unary operator that deletes a property from an object.

---

#### 4. Ternary Operator

- A conditional operator that uses three operands.
- Syntax: `condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse`.

---

#### 5. Operator Precedence

- Determines the order in which operators are evaluated, affecting the final result.

#### Types of Dialog Boxes

1. **Alert Dialog Box**
    
    - The simplest dialog box.
    - Displays a message and requires the user to click an OK button to close it.
    - Can be called using `alert()` or `window.alert()`.
    - Accepts one optional parameter (the message to display).
    - Code execution is halted until the dialog box is closed.
    

---

2. **Confirm Dialog Box**
    
    - Displays a message with two buttons: OK and Cancel.
    - Returns a Boolean value based on the user's choice:
        
        - `true` if OK is pressed.
        - `false` if Cancel is pressed.
        
    - Useful for conditional execution based on user decisions.
    

---

3. **Prompt Dialog Box**
    
    - Similar to the confirm dialog box but includes a text input field.
    - Accepts two optional parameters: a message and a default value for the text field.
    - Returns the input as a string if OK is pressed, or `null` if Cancel is pressed.
    - User input may need to be validated or converted to another type.
