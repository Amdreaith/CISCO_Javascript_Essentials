Operands - when operator can perform certain actions on arguments.


+  unary = 1 operand (ex: typeof , + , -)
+ + binary operator = 2 operands (ex:+)
+ ternary operator = 3 operands
+ prefix operator = occurs before the operand
+ postfix operator = after the operand
+ infix operator = between operands


1. Assignment Operators

syntax : =
This operator assigns the value of right operand to the left operand.

2. Arithmetic Operators

It's a good habit to add "()" to operations,to force the precedence and order of operations.

3. Unary Operator

ex :  + and -

Unary increment is ++
Unary decrement is --
*This is allowed in both prefix and postfix*

Postfix = right side (ex : n++)
Prefix = left side (ex: ++n)

4. Compound Assignment Operators

**Binary arithmetic operators** can be combined with the assignment operator, 
ex:  +=, -=,  /=,  %=  


5.  Logical Operators

- a conjunction, i.e. logical AND (&& symbol)
- an alternative, i.e. logical OR (symbol ||)
- a negation, i.e. logical NOT (symbol !)

5. Compound Assignment Operators
This can be used in combination with the assignment operator, creating a logical AND assignment &&= and a logical OR assignment ||=.

ex :         a &&= false;
