### I. What are Functions? (Code Blocks You Can Reuse!)

Imagine you have a specific task you do often, like calculating something or showing a message. Instead of writing that code over and over, you can wrap it up in a **function**!

A **function** is just a named chunk of code designed to do a specific job. You can call (or "run") this function by its name whenever you need that job done.

**Why use functions?**

I. Organize Code: They break down big programs into smaller, manageable parts. Easier to understand!

II. Reuse Code (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself): If you find yourself writing the same lines of code multiple times, put it in a function. Then, just call the function instead!

III. Easy to Change: If you need to update that repeated code, you only change it in one place (the function definition), not everywhere it's used.

IV. Testable: You can test individual functions to make sure they work correctly.

### II. Declaring Functions: Giving Your Code a Name

Before you can use a function, you need to **declare** it. This means giving it a name and defining what code it contains.

**Basic Setup:**

JavaScript

```
function functionName() {
    // This is the code the function will run
}
```

I. Starts with the keyword function.

II. Then comes your chosen functionName. (Follow variable naming rules!)

III. Parentheses () follow the name. These are for parameters (more on these soon!).

IV. Curly braces {} contain the actual code the function will execute. This is called the function body.

Example:

Let's declare a function that calculates the average temperature.

JavaScript

```
// We'll improve this later!
function getMeanTemp() {
    // For now, imagine 'temperatures' and 'sum' exist outside
    sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i++) {
        sum += temperatures[i];
    }
    meanTemp = sum / temperatures.length;
}
```

**Just declaring it doesn't run it!** It's like having a recipe but not actually cooking yet.

---

### III. Calling Functions: Making Your Code Run!

To make a function actually _do_ its job, you need to **call** it.

How to Call:

Just write the functionName followed by parentheses ().

Example:

Using our getMeanTemp function:

JavaScript

```
// (Function declaration would be here, like above)

let temperatures = [10, 20, 30]; // Example data
let sum;
let meanTemp;

getMeanTemp(); // <--- THIS line calls the function!
console.log(`Mean: ${meanTemp}`); // Will show 20
```

When `getMeanTemp()` is called, the program jumps into the function's code, runs it, and then comes back to continue from where it left off.

---

### IV. Functions & Local Variables: Their Own Space

Variables declared _inside_ a function (using `let` or `const`) are **local**. They only exist and are usable _within_ that function. They don't mess with variables outside the function that might have the same name.

**Why it's good:** It keeps your function's work private and prevents accidental changes to other parts of your code.

**Example:**

JavaScript

```
let globalVar = "I'm global!"; // Global variable

function myFunction() {
    let localVar = "I'm local!"; // Local variable
    console.log(globalVar); // Works!
    console.log(localVar);  // Works!
}

myFunction();
// console.log(localVar); // Error! 'localVar' doesn't exist outside 'myFunction'
```

Let's improve our `getMeanTemp` function by making `sum` a local variable:

JavaScript

```
function getMeanTemp() {
    let sum = 0; // 'sum' is now local to this function!
    for (let i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i++) { // Still using a global 'temperatures' for now
        sum += temperatures[i];
    }
    meanTemp = sum / temperatures.length; // Still assigning to global 'meanTemp'
}
```

---

### V. The `return` Statement: Getting a Result Back

Often, functions do some work and then **give back a result**. That's what `return` is for.

**What `return` does:**

I. Exits the function immediately: No more code in the function runs after return.

II. Sends a value back: Whatever you put after return is the value the function "gives back" to wherever it was called from. You can then store this value in a variable.

**Simple Rule:**

JavaScript

```
function calculateSomething() {
    // do some work...
    return theResult; // sends 'theResult' back
}

let outcome = calculateSomething(); // 'outcome' now holds 'theResult'
```

**Example (simple return):**

JavaScript

```
function sayHello() {
    return "Hello there!"; // This function always returns "Hello there!"
}
let greeting = sayHello(); // 'greeting' will be "Hello there!"
console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello there!
```

**Improving `getMeanTemp` with `return`:**

Now `getMeanTemp` can calculate and give back the mean, without needing a global `meanTemp` variable.

JavaScript

```
function getMeanTemp() {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i++) { // Still needs global 'temperatures'
        sum += temperatures[i];
    }
    return sum / temperatures.length; // Calculates and returns the mean directly
}

let day1Temps = [12, 12, 11, ...]; // Assume this array is defined globally for now
let meanForDay1 = getMeanTemp(); // Call it, and save the returned value
console.log(`Mean for Day 1: ${meanForDay1}`);
```

You can even put the function call directly into `console.log` if you don't need to save the result in a variable first:

JavaScript

```
console.log(`Mean for Day 1: ${getMeanTemp()}`);
```

### VI. Parameters: Giving Info TO Your Function

To make functions truly reusable and independent, they often need to receive information from the outside. This information is passed in using **parameters**.

**How it works:**

I. You list parameters in the () when you declare the function (e.g., function add(num1, num2)). These are like local variables inside the function that will hold the values you give it.

II. When you call the function, you put the actual values (called arguments) inside the () (e.g., add(5, 7)).

III. The arguments you pass are assigned to the parameters in order.

**Simple Rule:**

JavaScript

```
function doSomething(input1, input2) { // 'input1' and 'input2' are parameters
    // use input1 and input2 here
}

doSomething(valueA, valueB); // 'valueA' and 'valueB' are arguments
```

**Example (adding numbers):**

JavaScript

```
function add(firstNum, secondNum) { // 'firstNum' and 'secondNum' are parameters
    return firstNum + secondNum;
}

let total = add(5, 7); // 5 goes to 'firstNum', 7 goes to 'secondNum'
console.log(total); // Output: 12
```

**Making `getMeanTemp` truly independent:**

Now, let's make `getMeanTemp` take the `temperatures` array as a parameter. This means it no longer needs a global `temperatures` variable!

JavaScript

```
function getMeanTemp(measurements) { // 'measurements' is now a parameter
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < measurements.length; i++) {
        sum += measurements[i];
    }
    return sum / measurements.length;
}

let day1 = [12, 12, 11, 11, 10, 9, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 18, 21, 24, 24, 23, 25, 25, 23, 21, 20, 19, 17, 16]; // Our actual data for Day 1
let day2 = [17, 16, 14, 12, 10, 10, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 22, 27, 29, 29, 27, 26, 24, 21, 19, 18, 17, 16]; // Our actual data for Day 2

console.log(`Mean Day 1: ${getMeanTemp(day1)}`); // Pass day1 array as argument
console.log(`Mean Day 2: ${getMeanTemp(day2)}`); // Pass day2 array as argument
```

Now `getMeanTemp` can calculate the mean for _any_ array of numbers you give it! This is powerful **reusability**!

### VII. Shadowing: Local vs. Global Variables

When you have a **parameter** or a **local variable** inside a function with the same name as a **global variable**, the function will use its _own_ local version. This is called **shadowing**.

**Think of it like this:** If you have a toy named "bear" in your room (local) and there's also a big "bear" statue in the town square (global), when you're in your room, you're talking about _your_ toy bear, not the statue.

**Example:**

JavaScript

```
let x = 100; // Global x
let y = 200; // Global y
let z = 300; // Global z

function test(x) { // 'x' here is a parameter, it shadows the global 'x'
    let y = 10;   // 'y' here is a local variable, it shadows the global 'y'
    console.log(x); // Will be the value passed as argument (e.g., if you call test(5), it's 5)
    console.log(y); // Will be 10 (the local 'y')
    console.log(z); // Will be 300 (uses the global 'z' because no local 'z')
}

test(5); // Call the function, passing 5 for 'x'
// Output inside function: 5, 10, 300

console.log(x); // Output outside function: 100 (global 'x' is unchanged)
console.log(y); // Output outside function: 200 (global 'y' is unchanged)
console.log(z); // Output outside function: 300
```
